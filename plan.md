- george cup✅
- navigating rounds doesn't change the round view, still showing previous round fixtures. ✅\*\* now working but not showing blank fixtures.

- game weeks can still be changed after confirmed, this needs to be locked in.✅
- rounds not being counted and next round goes forever.\*\* now working when you arrive at the page, but not working when you have created fixtures, also further rounds still showing first rounds fixtures.✅
- submit is not working when editing a cup round.✅
- first round fixtures are showing in the right hand column in all rounds( when a new round has been selected by using the arrows on the header.)✅
- ensure that once fixtures have been selected that they are in place when returning to this screen.✅

- get players to start with 0-0 predictions until they have changed predictions.✅
- round progression working just needs display fix
- lock new rounds drop down menu until required amount of players are ready.

When you hit confirm on this we will then update the supabase as already set we will also now update the lavery_cup_rounds table is_complete and update the lavery_cup_selections table team1_won and team2_won on supabase.✅

- george cup doesn't show winners or player vs player games until next round is drawn, winners should show as soon as there are points in place.✅

23. Bugs

- URGENT - League table needs to be changed to match rules, add tie breaker.✅
- check routing to ensure that players who are logged in, get redirected from log in to the dashboard.✅
- game logic - scores not show points in my predictions until host has entered correct scores - my scores should not show host scores until host has entered them - This is causing players to see incorrect scores until host has entered correct scores.✅
- george cup - coin toss not done until host opens edit george cup component. This means players have to wait on host to manually flip a coin✅
- URGENT - host enter scores - when looking at the game weeks, a game week thats prediction window has closed but has not yet been edited says closed. This should say ready for correct scores or something like this. This may be fixed by the score modal issue where all correct scores show as 0-0 when the should be null.✅
- dashboard - need to test league tile view if you are not in the top 6✅
-
- add loading... to view seasons page when fetching seasons.✅
-
- enter scores any one who is signed up is able to enter scores, this should not be the case, only players game weeks should only show for player who are in that season on the season_players for the season that the game week is in.🔵
-
- delete game week - errors where it deletes the fixtures but not the game week
- delete season needs correcting
-
- white space at bottom when scrolling down in mobile view in view george cup, view lavery cup, edit george cup. Check other areas also.
- view george cup - scroll bar for columns is just off bottom of the page, same for view lavery cup and edit george cup
-
- message panel - dashboard needs refreshed to show changes when adding deleting or editing messages
-
- errors showing in console when going to my pedictions, enter scores page due to adding lavery cup selections
-
- page flickers and needs refresh when draw second round of cup. Loop issue in the perform draw function.This rerendering is causing lots of rest api calls this could become a big issue.
