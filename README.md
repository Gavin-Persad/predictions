# Football Predictions App

A web application built to digitise and automate a local football predictions competition that was previously managed manually. This project helps the competition organiser transition to retirement by automating the management of predictions, scoring, league tables, and cup competitions.

## Motivation

This project was initiated to help a valued member of our community who has been running a football predictions competition manually for many years. As they approach retirement, this application ensures the competition can continue with minimal manual intervention while adding new features and improvements.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Supabase (Authentication & Database)
- Dark Mode Support
- Responsive Design

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16.8 or later
- npm or yarn
- A Supabase account

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/predictions.git
   cd predictions
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables:
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with:

   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

4. Set up Supabase tables: The application requires multiple tables (schema definitions below).

5. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Game Rules and Scoring

### Match Predictions

- Each game week consists of 10 fixtures
- Predictions must be submitted before midnight the day before the first game
- Late predictions or missed deadlines result in a default 0-0 prediction

### Points System

- **Exact Score Points:**
  - 3 points: Correct exact score with 3 or fewer total goals
  - 4 points: Correct exact score with 4 total goals
  - 5 points: Correct exact score with 5 total goals
  - 6+ points: Points equal to total goals in the match for higher-scoring games
- **Partial Points:**
  - 1 point: Correct result only (home win, away win, or draw)
  - 0 points: Completely incorrect prediction
- **Bonus Points:**
  - 2 bonus points: Unique correct score (being the only player to predict the exact score)
  - Weekly accuracy bonuses:
    - 4 correct scores in one week: +1 point
    - 5 correct scores in one week: +2 points
    - 6+ correct scores in one week: +3 points

### Cup Competitions

#### George Cup

- Knockout tournament with head-to-head matchups
- Players randomly drawn against each other in rounds
- Player with higher points total for that week advances
- Tiebreakers:
  - Most correct scores in the week
  - If still tied, automated coin flip decides winner
- Tournament progresses through rounds of 32, 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals, and final

#### Lavery Cup

- Team selection tournament format
- Each round, players select two teams they believe will win
- Players can only use each team once during the entire tournament
- Both selected teams must win in 90 minutes for the player to advance
- Players are eliminated if either team loses or draws
- Last player remaining after all rounds is the winner
- Tournament resets if all players are eliminated in a round

### League Table

- Players ranked by total points accumulated over the season
- Tiebreakers:
  - Most correct scores predicted
